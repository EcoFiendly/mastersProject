# Thesis writing and submission guidelines

## Should be submitted in pdf format
### Adhere to following guidelines:
Coverpage:  
- include project title, name and month and year of submission.
Following text must appear at bottom of cover page:  
    - A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Research at Imperial College London Submitted for the MRes in CMEE
- declaration: first page inside the cover must provide a brief declaration of the contributions made by you and by others to your project. Key points to address are:  
    - was the data provided or did you collect or assemble it
    - were you responsible for data processing or cleaning
    - were any mathematical models developed by you or by your supervisor
    - what role, if any, did your supervisor play in developing the analyses presented

Data and code availability statement:  
At end of main text, before references section, must provide a statement titled "Data and Code Availability", where you name a data and a code archive from where the data and code can be obtained that will allow replication of your results. The code may be in the form of a single script file. If the data cannot be made available publicly (e.g. because it is yet to be formally published), or if there are other confidentiality issues with submitting the data, speak with your course director and supervisor, and include a clear statement about why the data cannot be made available.  
- Structure and style:  
Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion and possibly a separate Conclusions section. Do not format to look like a paper from a specific journal
- Word limit:  
6000 excluding figures, tables, referencess and appendices/supplementary information.   
Upper limit of 8 figures and tables. If more than 8, think carefully about wether they are all crucial to helping the reader understand the paper, if they are, include them; if not, move to supplementary material    
Published paper often use complex multipart figures to reduce figure counts. Bringing related figs and tables together is good practice but often time consuming. Prioritize making selected figs and tables clear and informative, don't spend time and effort merging figures unless there's free time
- Use Helvetica, Arial or Times new roman at 11 or 12 point size.
- Use in text citation style

Typesetting:

a beamer presentation template is also available there

## Thesis content
Few ways in which thesis is likely to differ from typical scientific paper:
- make sure to clearly state aims/hypothesis/questions towards end of intro
- take care to explain everything adequately so examiners can see clear evidence of understanding of all the concepts and methods, this might entail providing more detail or background in the introduction and methods than in a typical paper. However, some of this detail can be put in an appendix / supplementary info
- make clear what you did versus what you were provided with. E.g. did you collect the data that you analysed or were they provided to you by someone else? Did you build the model yourself or were you given one that you then analysed or simulated? Did you write all the simulation or analysis code yourself?

You should make sure to discuss limitations of your study and what future work you would do to address those limitations or other questions raised by your work

Guidelines and tips from Andy Purvis:
- Introduction:  
A good intro should leave the reader with a clear idea of the problem to be tackled and looking forward to the more detailed sections to follow. Include a section on the general way the problem has been approached. An essential concluding part of the intro is to clearly define the aims of the project and any hypothese tested. Also think about:   
    - what is this paper about? (the broad area, big picture) Why is it interesting?
    - given it's so interesting, why don't we know the answer?
    - so, what is this about, more specifically? What are hypothesized to be the important things? Build from the most general and fundamental hypotheses to the most refined or tenuous ones.
    - How, roughly and briefly, will you go about testing these hypotheses? Why are you using this system? What approach will you use?
    - State clearly what your hypotheses are

- Methods:  
Contain details of any methods used extensively during the project, layout of theoretical methods, methods of statistical analyses etc. Can use subheadings for different procedures or tests. If field work is done, a general description of the study area may be included here. Extra methodological details can be placed in appendices. Golden rule is that the reader should be able to repeat what you did, should they so wish. The other rule, more important for your project rather than in a paper, is that you describe in enough detail to show you've understood what you did.
