Heatmap of topic distribution for each of the red list category

Heatmap of topic distribution for each of the systems

Heatmap of topic distribution for each of the realms
\
Will investigate this. Looks like aquatic species which exist across multiple realms weigh heavily 
## what I will do 
Read and Write

questions:

Can I use "I" in the report

\

How verbose for explaining methodology
Use the figure to illustrate the text preprocessing or also include paragraph to describe

## research questions

- RQ1 what does the topic model tell us

- RQ2 how do the topics vary across different red list categories

- RQ3 how do the topics differ across different systems (i.e. terrestrial, marine, freshwater)
  \
  look for biological papers related to to support discussion

- RQ4 how do the topics vary across different realms
  determine topic(s) for each entry, then map to corresponding realm(s)
